        Hello! My name is Annapurna and I am a knowledge omnivore. I was a bit of global hobo growing up, but fell in love with Chicago 13 years ago, and adopted it as my own sweet home! Now I spread the Chicago gospel everywhere I go.
        </div>

        <div id="column2">
        I have an eclectic and varied background, including experience in law, science, communication, policy advocacy, hospitality, event management, tourism, and small business entrepreneurship.
      </div>

        <div id="column3">
        I now want to empower myself, and eventually others, by learning how to create, own, and manage one's digital presence and data. In the future, I hope to use these skills to further the social and environmental justice issues I care about.
