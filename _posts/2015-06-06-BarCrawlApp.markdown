**Description**

Choose Your Own Disaster:

A customizable bar crawl that uses geolocation through Google Maps to help you plot out your fun night of dranking in the Greatest City in the World: Chicago. Choose to start where you are (Unkie Google already knows...) or start somewhere else by entering an address (thanks, Yelp API!). Add bars to your crawl, and start walking (and eventually, hopefully, crawling). Bon Dranking! (There is also a DrunkChat feature that allows you to make ridiculous comments to your fellow crawlers via your phone-machine).

We used Ruby on Rails, Google Maps, Yelp API, jQuery, and AJAX.

**Technologies Used**

- Used Ruby on Rails to serve static content with ERB

- Used jQuery and AJAX

- Used Google's geolocation and Google Maps for location services

- Used the Yelp API to find detailed information about bars near your chosen start point so that you can make informed drinking decisions ... before you start drinking when you still have your faculties about you.
