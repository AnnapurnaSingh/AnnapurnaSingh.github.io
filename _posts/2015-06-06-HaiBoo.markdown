**Description**

HaiBoo!!!
(A new Haiku / for you / to send / to your Boo!!!)

I used Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap to serve content and theme my application. I also used Nokogiri to scrape websites for open-source Haikus, create an API with them, and used AJAX calls to take 3 different lines from 3 different Haikus to create a new Hybrid Frankenstein Haiku (called HaiBoo). I then used Nexmo (in colloboration with the incredible Sarah Bump) to allow the user to text the HaiBoo to their Boo (or boos).

**Technologies Used**

- Used Ruby on Rails to serve static content with ERB

- Used jQuery and AJAX

- Used Bootstrap for theming the application

- Used Nokogiri to scrape websites to create my API
